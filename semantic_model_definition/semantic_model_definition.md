# Semantic Model vs Ontology vs Knowledge Graph: Untangling the latest data modeling terminology

I ended the 2023 year with some great news from collaborator [Will Davis](https://posgeo.wordpress.com/): our paper [â€œKnowledge Graphs for Seismic Data and Metadata"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acags.2023.100151) has been accepted for a special issue of *Applied Computing and Geosciences*, on "Geoscience Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs." Full disclosure, I know next to nothing about the geosciences, that's Will's department, but I have been up to my eyeballs in knowledge graphs for the past three years. As the paper is aimed at a geoscience audience, we needed to be a precise as possible introducing data modeling terminology. With the preponderance of recent [blog](https://blog.metaphacts.com/importance-of-semantic-knowledge-graph) [discussion](https://www.wisecube.ai/blog/primer-on-knowledge-graphs/)  [defining](https://medium.com/hackernoon/wtf-is-a-knowledge-graph-a16603a1a25f) [just](https://medium.com/@bentoth/knowledge-graphs-are-a-dying-technology-9dc37c313f3f) [what](https://www.semanticarts.com/property-graphs-training-wheels-on-the-way-to-knowledge-graphs/) [a](https://neo4j.com/blog/rdf-triple-store-vs-labeled-property-graph-difference/) "[knowledge](https://www.wisecube.ai/blog/knowledge-graphs-rdf-or-property-graphs-which-one-should-you-pick/) [graph](https://lopezyse.medium.com/your-guide-to-knowledge-graphs-509c847f3d69)" [is](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knowledge-graph), folks outside this space may understandably find the jargon muddled.

Particularly I was interested in distinguishing 3 terms, "semantic model", "ontology", and "knowledge graph". The first two in particular are [often used interchangeably](https://blog.metaphacts.com/importance-of-semantic-knowledge-graph). And "knowledge graph", as a concept, [gets entangled](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knowledge-graph) with [implementation choice](https://www.semanticarts.com/property-graphs-training-wheels-on-the-way-to-knowledge-graphs/) (ie, [RDF vs LPG](https://www.stardog.com/knowledge-graph/)). In our paper, I included this sentence which subtlely does the heavy lifting to clarify the relationship between these 3 terms:

> We first outline a semantic model consisting of two KG ontologies [...].

Let's break this down. We immediately introduce a sense of hierarchy between "semantic model" and "ontology". And assert that more than one ontology can exist within a semantic model. The term knowledge graph (KG) is used as an adjective, describing the *type* of ontology, with the implication that not all ontologies can be realized as knowledge graphs.

## First, let's dig into ontologies

To be clear, in defining these terms this way, we are making a statement of opinion. Language is how you use it, and especially with the recent rise in popularity of "semantic model" (and the confusingly homonymous terms "semantic layer", "semantic web", "semantic network"...), it is worth ensuring new jargon becomes an upstanding, contributing member of our lexicon. As a synonym of "ontology", this potential is wasted.

So what is an ontology? In our paper, we define it as "a formal description of the concepts and relationships within a domain". Gartner uses a similar definition in [this document](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/2990119): **"Ontologies are structural frameworks for organizing information and are used as knowledge representation."** The common vein is that there is a level of formalism required to define an ontology. In other words, from the ontology, we should have all the information required to construct the knowledge graph.

In our paper, we represent ontologies with [Object Role Modeling (ORM)](http://www.orm.net/) diagrams, which describe formal relationships between entities (as "facts") and include explicit representation of data constraints. (This is where so much of the *knowledge* is! But that's a post for another day.) ORM is ideal for knowledge graph ontologies because of its power to capture these constraints, as well as support for diagramming other graph core concepts: [hypergraphs](https://towardsdatascience.com/representation-learning-on-rdf-and-lpg-knowledge-graphs-6a92f2660241), reification, and entity identifiers. As a bonus, every fact in an ORM diagram also maps directly to either a relation or integrity constraint in the RelationalAI [Rel language](https://docs.relational.ai/rel) which we used to implement the KG. 

Importantly, because all facts are rendered explicitly, an ORM diagram is not constrained to a particular implementation paradigm: the ontology described may be realized as a knowledge graph with RDF, LPG, Relational Knowledge Graph (RKG), etc.

## So, what is a semantic model?

What about the semantic model? [Gartner's definition]((https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/semantic-data-model)) is quite open-ended, **"A method of organizing data that reflects the basic meaning of data items and the relationships among them."** The semantic model becomes the largest scale representation of a domain, capturing the business terms, expected relationships between them, as well as what kind of data might be attached to these terms. Ontologies in the domain would then follow these *semantics*. 

In other words, the semantic model is like the dictionary of the domain, and each ontology is a collection of sentences that use the dictionary vocabulary. From the semantic model, I can understand the data value units ("adjectives"), the meaning of edge labels ("verbs") and node labels ("nouns"). Ok, I'll stop with the analogy here. As much as possible, every ontology should take advantage of the shared vocabulary of the semantic model.

In our paper, we needed a common language (semantic model) to describe two subsets of our domain: seismic events and seismic stations that measured them. Each subdomain uses its own data sources, and those sources do not contain direct linkages to data in the other subdomain. We modeled each subdomain as *an ontology within the semantic model*. The knowledge graphs we populated each followed just one ontology.

This closely mirrors most enterprises: separate parts of the business will have their own data sources and modeling needs, but must speak a common language across the business. Since each ontology uses its own data to define its entities, and may not contain specific links to data in other ontologies, traversing across the ontologies requires entity resolution and value comparison strategies.

But hey, this is precisely what knowledge graphs are good at. Especially when they share semantics.

## Are you going to define knowledge graph now?

Oh heck no. I'll add my blog entry to that pantheon later. I'll just add this note on how knowledge graphs should relate to their ontology. Analogy time again: if the ontology is the architectural plan, the knowledge graph is the building. An ontology is most useful when it provides a *complete description of the model requirements of the KG*. That is, I can define my DSL or schema mapping method for knowledge graph construction if I know just my data source schema and my ontology.

"Complete" may depend on the implementation. Here's an example. The RKG implementation of our seismic models required an understanding of the full preferred identifier of each entity type node. That is, we needed all of the data necessary to uniquely identify nodes for each node type. We used this data to construct the node identifier (as a hash). A KG construction method that randomly assigns unique node ids would not require this to be part of the ontology.

The most flexible ontologies are agnostic to implementation choices, and therefore offer as complete a description of the domain subset as possible. This allows the data model to outlive a particular knowledge graph technology stack. Ultimately the knowledge graph is a tool, a link in a decision making chain. A primary advantage of KGs is that they can adapt and extend with the data that feeds them, without breaking that chain. This flexibility should extend to the knowledge graph management system itself.
